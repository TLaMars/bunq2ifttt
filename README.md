# bunq2IFTTT

This app creates an interface between the [bunq](https://www.bunq.com/) 
banking API and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

Create your own private service on the [IFTTT
Platform](https://platform.ifttt.com/) and self-host the bunq2IFTTT app,
e.g. in [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).

Features are:
- Real time triggers on mutations, balances and incoming requests
- The ability to make (draft) payments
- Security oriented, using OAuth where possible and by separating the API key
  in a separate instance using master/slave mode where it is really needed

See the [Wiki page](https://github.com/woudt/bunq2ifttt/wiki) for [installation
and usage instructions](https://github.com/woudt/bunq2ifttt/wiki).

Also, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/woudt/bunq2ifttt/wiki/Changelog)
if you have installed a previous version to see what is changed and if there
are any specific upgrade instructions.
